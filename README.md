# Chatbot
Growing up, I spent a lot of time talking to my friends on MSN Messenger. I also spent a lot of this time testing the limitations of MSN's chatbot, SmarterChild...

This application was built to reminisce on these days while testing out Mozilla's Web Speech API. This chatbot (affectionately called Botty McBotface after [this](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-36064659)) uses the SpeechSythensis and SpeechRecognition interfaces to allow the user to communicate with the bot. 

Currently users can communicate using text input. Voice input is to be added.

# Instructions
Simply enter your text into the input field to begin your conversation.

# Browser Support
Please note that support for Web Speech API speech recognition is currently limited to Chrome for Desktop and Android.
