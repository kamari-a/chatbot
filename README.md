# Chatbot
Growing up, I spent a lot of time talking to friends on MSN Messenger. I also spent a lot of this time testing the limitations of MSN's chatbot, SmarterChild. This application was built to reminisce on these memories while giving me the chance to experiment with the Web Speech API. 

This chatbot (affectionately called Botty McBotface after [this British vote](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-36064659)) uses the SpeechSythensis and SpeechRecognition interfaces to allow the user to communicate with the bot. 

Currently users can communicate with the bot using text input. Voice input will be added soon.

# Instructions
Enter your text into the input field and press enter/return on your keyboard to start your conversation.

# Browser Support
Please note that support for Web Speech API speech recognition is currently limited to Chrome for Desktop and Android.
